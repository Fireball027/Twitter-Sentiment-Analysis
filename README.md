# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

The **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. This project involves training a machine learning model on historical Twitter data and evaluating its performance in predicting sentiment for unseen tweets.

---

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares Twitter data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Builds a sentiment classification model using machine learning algorithms.
- **Prediction and Evaluation**: Predicts sentiment on test data and evaluates model accuracy.
- **Result Visualization**: Displays insights using visualizations.

## Project Files

### 1. `main.py`
This is the core script responsible for training the model, making predictions, and visualizing results.

#### Key Components:
- **Data Loading**:
  - Loads the training (`train.csv`) and test (`test.csv`) datasets.
- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Cleans tweets by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuations, and converting text to lowercase.
- **Model Training**:
  - Utilizes machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes for sentiment classification.
- **Prediction and Evaluation**:
  - Generates predictions for the test dataset and evaluates model performance.
- **Result Export**:
  - Saves predictions in `result.csv`.

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load training data
data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

# Preprocessing
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(data['tweet'])
y = data['label']

# Model training
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction and evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### 2. `train.csv`
The dataset used to train the sentiment analysis model. It typically includes:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each tweet.
- **label**: Sentiment label (`0`: negative, `1`: positive).
- **tweet**: The text content of the tweet.

### 3. `test.csv`
The dataset used to evaluate the model. Similar to `train.csv` but without sentiment labels.

### 4. `result.csv`
Contains the predicted sentiment labels for the test dataset. It includes:
- **id**: Corresponding to the test dataset.
- **label**: Predicted sentiment label.

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Run the Analysis
Execute the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: View Results
- Check `result.csv` for predicted sentiments.
- Visualizations (if implemented) will display model performance.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced NLP Models**: Integrate models like BERT for improved accuracy.
- **Real-time Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze live tweets using Twitter APIs.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Build dynamic visualizations with Streamlit or Dash.
- **Multilingual Support**: Extend analysis to support tweets in multiple languages.

## Conclusion
The **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** project effectively demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to understand public opinion. By analyzing sentiment, businesses and individuals can gain valuable insights from social media data.

Feel free to enhance and adapt this project to your needs!
